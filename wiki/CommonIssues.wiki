#summary Some pointers for common issues encountered while setting up ampache
=Common Issues=

=== Works on WiFi but not EVDO ===
  * Are you connecting to a 192.168.x.x IP Address?  Most WiFi routers have an internal IP pool and one External IP.  
    * 192.168.x.x is Internal and not accessible via EVDO
    * To find your external address try this link [http://www.whatismyip.com/]
  * Once you determine your internal address and external IP address you need to setup port forwarding on your router.
    * Your goal is to forward your External IP address to your Internal Ampache Server address.
    * [http://www.portforward.com/routers.htm This site] has a ton of port forwarding guides, most webservers default to running on port 80.  But you can choose any port you like as long as your configure your web server as such.
