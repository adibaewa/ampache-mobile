#summary Some pointers for common issues encountered while setting up ampache
=Common Issues=

=== Ampache-mobile doesn't work ===
   * If Ampache-mobile run's OK on your pre, but you are unable to connect to your music server, use the test below to help you figure out why Ampache-mobile isn't working.
        # Can you access Ampache from the machine it is running on (i.e http://localhost)?  If no, then it looks like your Ampache music server is not working yet.
        # Can you access Ampache from another machine on your network (i.e. http://192.168.x.x) ? If no, it could be a firewall issue on the machine running the Amapche music server or maybe an Ampache Server ACL rule. 
           * See this [http://www.ehow.com/how_2317017_turn-off-firewalls-computer.html page] on "how to turn off your firewall".
           * Check out this [http://ampache.org/wiki/config:acl page] on Ampache ACL rules  
        # Can you access Ampache via Wifi from your Pre using the web browser (i.e. http://192.168.x.x)? If no, it could be a firewall issue on the machine running the Amapche music server or maybe an ACL rule. See links above.
        # Can you access Ampache via Wifi from your Pre using Ampache-mobile?
   * You may want to go through the steps above before posting a "Ampache-mobile isn't working" post and then posting which of the above steps worked for you and which didn't. 
=== Works on Wi-Fi but not EVDO ===
  * Are you connecting to a private network address IP Address like 192.168.x.x  or 10.x.x.x or 172.16.x.x?  Most Wi-Fi routers have an internal IP pool and one External IP.  
    * A 192.168.x.x/10.x.x.x/172.16.x.x address is Internal and not accessible via EVDO
    * To find your external address try this link [http://www.whatismyip.com/]
  * Once you determine your internal address and external IP address you need to setup port forwarding on your router.
    * Your goal is to forward your External IP address to your Internal Ampache Server address. Imagine that your router is a large building with 100's of doors. 
        * Each door has a unique "port number". 
        * Each door opens onto a hallway that goes to an unique suite with the same "port number". (i.e. Suite 80)
        * The Ampache server by default is occupying suite 80, office 192.168.x.x. (where 192.168.x.x is the private IP address of the Ampache server)
        * Some ISPs block door 80...they install a lock on the outside of the door and you cannot unlock it 
        * To get around this, you open up another door...as an example door 8080. At the same time you build a hallway in the building so anyone coming in on door 8080 is automatically directed to suite 80, office 192.168.x.x .
    
    * [http://www.portforward.com/routers.htm This site] has a ton of port forwarding guides, most webservers default to running on port 80.  But you can choose any port you like as long as your configure your web server as such. 
  * Could be an ACL issue. Ampache uses Access Control Lists to restrict access to the music server (see http://ampache.org/wiki/config:acl). You will need to create a an ACL rule for EVDO access
     * Go to the Ampache Admin page
     * click on "Add ACL"
        * Name it (ex: EVDO Streaming) 
        * Level = all
        * User = all
        * ACL type = Stream Access
        * Remote Key =            (leave blank)
        * Start = 0.0.0.0 
        * End =  255.255.255.255
     * click on "Create ACL"


=== Transcoding not working  ===
  * Transcoding tools are not installed as part of Apache/XAMMP. You must download and install them separately. Here are some links to get you started :
     * LAME : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAME
     * FLAC : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flac
     * FACC : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding#FAAC_and_FAAD2
     * Mp3splt : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mp3splt
     * oggsplt/oggdec  : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg
     * ALAC : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alac
  * If things are not working, look at the Ampache log file on the music server for the command Ampache is running. Copy it and try to run it on the command line. [http://ampache.org/wiki/support#enabling_logging Enable Logging]
  * You set the default sample rate on the Ampache Admin page-> streaming. It is called "Transcode Bitrate".
  * The ";" is a comment character in the Aampache configuration file. Everything on the line after it is a comment and will not be executed. By default most transcoding commands are commented out -- they will not run.
  * Use the Amapche log file...it can REALLY help you to figure out why things are not working.
