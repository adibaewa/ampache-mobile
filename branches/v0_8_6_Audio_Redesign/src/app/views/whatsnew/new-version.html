         New Features
     </div>

     <ul class="new-version-list">
         <li>Buffer Ahead! (thanks for waiting)</li>
         <ul class="new-version-list">
            <li>Configurable from 1 to 5 songs</li>             
            <li>This is true buffer ahead, using system RAM.  Other solutions download to flash, which is bad for your device.</li>
            <li>Intellegent buffer selection, attempts to provide seemless playback with no downloading break between tracks.</li>
            <li>Many work arounds for bugs in webOS, don't think many people have attempted to use webOS in this way.</li>
            <li>Auto Detection of changes in network coverage and buffer stalls</li>
            <li>Auto Detection of buffers lost due to device sleep</li>
            <li>I've done my best to make this stable without transcoding, but it really shines when you enable it with transcoding.</li>
            <li>Settings in the Accounts Settings Page</li>
         </ul>
         
        
        <li>Artists and Albums List Caching</li>
            <ul class="new-version-list">
            <li>Saves a local copy of your entire albums and artists lists, load times are ridiculous!</li>
            <li>Auto detects when a change to your server occurs and resaves the lists.  Note: if you have auto scanning enabled on your server this will cause the list to redownload on every load.</li> 
            <li>Only applies to full Albums and Artist lists, everything else still goes against the server.</li>
            </ul>
     </ul>

     <div class="new-version-header">
         <b>Improvements</b>
     </div>

     <ul class="new-version-list">
        
         <li>Figured out how to use the Shift and Sym Keys, updated the controls popup with changes.</li>
         <li>Lowered the search character limit to 2.</li>
         <li>Redesign of the Accounts Settings Page to Accomidate all the new options.</li>
         <li>Added a whole more shuffle to the playlist shuffle.</li>
         <li>Changed repeat list once to repeat song.</li>
         <li>Banner notifications where they felt right.</li>
         <li>Shuffling a list now displays the list in the order playback will occur.</li>
     </ul>

     <div class="new-version-header">
         <b>Bug Fixes</b>
     </div>

     <ul class="new-version-list">
         <li>None Yet, but I probably made a bunch of new ones with all these new features.</li>
     </ul>
