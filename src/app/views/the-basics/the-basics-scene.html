			What is Ampache Mobile?
		</div>

		<div style="margin: 0px" class="palm-body-text condensed" x-mojo-loc="x-mojo-loc">
			Ampache Mobile is a webOS application for streaming music from an <a href="http://ampache.org/">Ampache Music Server</a>. Using this application with an Ampache Music Server you can stream all of YOUR music over your internet connection anywhere you take your mobile phone. It operates much like most music players you have used in the past. The major difference is everything is streaming over the network and nearly no space is devoted to storing music on your device.<br>
			<br>
			<b>WARNING</b>
			<hr>
			This app requires an Ampache Server to connect to. <strong>That means you will be responsible for installing and configuring your very own web server</strong>. Setting up Ampache is not a hard task but it's also not trivial. If you are a beginner be sure to read up and look to the forums at ampache.org and precentral.net for help and be prepared to spend some time.
