            <li>Lets face it, the old icon is kinda ugly. Thankfully forum contributor Globex has stepped up and volunteered his services and designed a new one along with anew splash screen!<br>
            <br>
            It still pays homage to the people at the Ampache project, aka it features their squirrel logo but I hope you agree with me, it looks a lot better on the phone.<br>
            <br>
