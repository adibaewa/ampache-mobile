<ul class="new-version-list">
  <li>Buffer Ahead! (thanks for waiting) 
    <ul class="new-version-list">
      <li>Configurable from 1 to 5 songs </li>

      <li>This is true buffer ahead, using system RAM. Other solutions download to flash, which is bad for your device. </li>

      <li>Intelligent buffer selection, attempts to provide seamless playback with no downloading break between tracks. </li>

      <li>Many work arounds for bugs in webOS, don't think many people have attempted to use webOS in this way. </li>

      <li>Auto Detection of changes in network coverage and buffer stalls </li>

      <li>Auto Detection of buffers lost due to device sleep </li>

      <li>I've done my best to make this stable without transcoding, but it really shines when you enable it with transcoding. </li>

      <li>Settings in the Accounts Settings Page </li>
      <li>Updated the error reporting to follow the new audio api</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Artists and Albums List Caching 
    <ul class="new-version-list">
      <li>Saves a local copy of your entire albums and artists lists, load times are ridiculous! </li>

      <li>Auto detects when a change to your server occurs and resaves the lists. Note: if you have auto scanning enabled on your server this will cause the list to redownload on every load. </li>

      <li>Only applies to full Albums and Artist lists, everything else still goes against the server. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="new-version-header"><b>Improvements</b> </div>

<ul class="new-version-list">
  <li>Figured out how to use the Shift and Sym Keys, updated the controls popup with changes. </li>

  <li>Lowered the search character limit to 2. </li>

  <li>Redesign of the Accounts Settings Page to Accommodate all the new options. </li>

  <li>Added a whole more shuffle to the playlist shuffle. </li>

  <li>Changed repeat list once to repeat song. </li>

  <li>Banner notifications where they felt right. </li>

  <li>Shuffling a list now displays the list in the order playback will occur. </li>
</ul>

<div class="new-version-header"><b>Bug Fixes</b> </div>

<ul class="new-version-list">
  <li>None Yet, but I probably made a bunch of new ones with all these new features. </li>
</ul>
